As stated in the web site

  "`Project Haystack`_ is an open source initiative to streamline 
  working with data from the Internet of Things. We standardize 
  semantic data models and web services with the goal of making 
  it easier to unlock value from the vast quantity of data being 
  generated by the smart devices that permeate our homes, buildings, 
  factories, and cities. Applications include automation, control, 
  energy, HVAC, lighting, and other environmental systems."
