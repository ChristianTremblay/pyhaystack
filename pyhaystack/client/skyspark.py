        Skyspark will not accept GET request for his_read by default
        [ref : https://project-haystack.org/forum/topic/787#c6]
            The default behavior of SkySpark is now to disallow GET requests 
            non-idempotent operations. So its still allowed on certain operations 
            such as about, formats, read. However as Chris said it can be toggled 
            back on using Settings|API for backward compatibility.

            However as a recommendation I think we should always be using POST as 
            a safer alternative. Using GET for ops with side-effects is against 
            the HTTP spec. Plus it is an attack vector if cookies are involved. 
            And it provides a more precise way to pass the request payload.

            Its not really from a theoretical perspective. But in SkySpark 
            we allow customers to generate histories using their own custom 
            functions. So from a security perspective we took the safest route 
            and consider it to potentially have side effects.
            If your code is all using GET, then just have the customer set 
            Settings|API allowGetWithSideEffects flag to false and it should all work.
